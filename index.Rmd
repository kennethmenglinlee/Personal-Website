I'm a <b>post-doctoral researcher</b> in <b>Biostatistics</b> at the <b>University of Pennsylvania</b> (Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, & Informatics). I previously completed my PhD in Biostatistics at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.

Iâ€™m currently working on evaluating time-varying intervention effects, informative sizes, and unmeasured confounding in different Cluster Randomized Trial designs. I've also previously developed methods to control for bias in Self-Controlled Case Series.
